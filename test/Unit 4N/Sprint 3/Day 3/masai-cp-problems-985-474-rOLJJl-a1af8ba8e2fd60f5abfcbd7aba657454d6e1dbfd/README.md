## Some Rules to follow:-

- Before writing a single line of code please read the problem statement very carefully.
- Don't change the already given ids or classes.

## Problem Statement:-
- In the template there are two input tags and 4 buttons.
- When clicked on any of the buttons perform the correct mathematical operation on the numbers and show an alert with the values.
- Let's say the value in the first input tag is 4 and the second input tag is 2 and the user clicks on the `Add` button then show an alert with 8.
- Just like that the user should also be able to multiply,subtract and devide as well.

- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time.
